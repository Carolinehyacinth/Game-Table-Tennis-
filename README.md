# Game-Table-Tennis

In the project, the single chip microcomputer was given by the professor. 

In the game, we use two buttons as the activity of two players, four LEDs to show the ball's trajectory and two digital tubes to show the scores of two players.

The game was divided into three different parts: 
1) Remove the shakes of the buttons (come from mechanical elastic switch); 

2) Show the results (LED and digital tubes); 

3) The operation of the game. 

In the operation of the game, we need to relieve these functions: 
i) judge which player has the service of the game; 
ii) use 8 bit binary signal to record the location of the ball; 
iii) judge whether players hit the ball at the right time (when the LED closest to the player is on); 
iV) when the player hits the ball, the direction of the ball will change and when the player does not hit the ball, the other player will get one point; 
V) if one player get 11 points, he will win the game and the game will finish.
